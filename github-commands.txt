# GitHub
- It is software service for hosting remote repositories from git.
- It is stored on cloud and can be used for collobaration to any user in the world
- It required an account to access the repositories
- It can clone any hosted repositories

# Cloning
- local copy the project from remote repositories 
- It configures git for you & connects local to remote branch
git clone <URL>

# Remote Repo
> Set
git remote add <LOCAL BRANCH> <GIT REPOSITORY URL>

> Rename
git remote rename <OLD> <NEW>

> Remove
git remote remove <NAME>

> Verbose
git remote -v

> View all remote branchs 
git remote -r

# Pushing
git push <REMOTE NAME> <BRANCH>

> Local branch can be different compare to master
git push <REMOTE NAME> <LOCAL BRANCH>:<REMOTE BRANCH>

> Connect Local branch to Master Branch & later we can just use "git push"
git push -u <REMOTE NAME> <LOCAL BRANCH>:<REMOTE BRANCH>

> To delete remote branches
git push <REMOTE NAME> --delete <BRANCH NAME>

# Pulling
- branch: It pulls the all branches on remote to local but doesnt create local copy [use: git switch <BRANCH NAME>]
- Code: It will download the code to local but doesnt make any change in working repository 
- It is combination of GIT MERGE + GET FETCH
git pull <REMOTE NAME> <BRANCH>

> Connect Local branch to Master Branch & later we can just use "git pull"
git pull -u <REMOTE NAME> <LOCAL BRANCH>:<REMOTE BRANCH>

# Fetch
- branch: It pulls the all branches on remote to local but doesnt create local copy [use: git switch <BRANCH NAME>]
- Code: It will download the code to local but doesnt make any change in working repository 
git fetch <REMOTE NAME>
git fetch <REMOTE NAME> <BRANCH>

# Git fetch vs Git Merge
- fetch gets changes from remote branch and updates all remote branch 
whereas pull gets the changes from remote branch and updates current branch only
- fetch doesnt merge any changes to HEAD branch
whereas pull merges changes to HEAD branch of current branch
- fetch is safe to be done anytime 
whereas pull can result in conflicts
